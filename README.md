## Fix Blurry Edge Browser Video
I've Tried sm tweaks to enhance overall windows system DPI but nothing helps with clearing and sharpning 720p , 1080p feeling 

 - Tried turning off hardware acceleration , worked but slowed over all browser performance
 - Changing windows DPI
 - Setting Edge.exe Dpi to be set by application
 - turn on/off Nvidia AA and FXAA
 
Nothing Really Working Till I Dig into **[Edge://flags](Edge://flags)** and Change ANGLE graphic to **DirectX9 or DirectX11on12** , OpenGl and DirectX 11 have same probleme
